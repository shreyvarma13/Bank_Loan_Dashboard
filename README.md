This project is an interactive **Bank Loan Dashboard** built in Microsoft Excel.
It provides a comprehensive analysis of the bank’s lending activities and portfolio health using key financial metrics such as **Loan Applications, Funded Amounts, Amounts Received, Interest Rates,** and **Debt-to-Income Ratios (DTI)**.

## Project Overview

The **Bank Loan Dashboard** helps banking professionals monitor, assess, and visualize lending performance across various dimensions such as **loan status, region, term, purpose, and home ownership**.
